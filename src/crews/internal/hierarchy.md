Project summary for AI collaboration
This is a request to onboard a new AI or human collaborator to a CrewAI project. The primary goal is to build a secure, automated development and maintenance workflow.
Project context
The project uses CrewAI to create multi-agent systems for various tasks, with a focus on a distributed architecture.
Central Router: A DistributedRouter dynamically assigns tasks to available LLMs, optimizing performance.
Modular Crews: Different crews are defined for specific categories (customer_service, coding, math, tech_support).
Public vs. Internal: A clear distinction has been established between public-facing crews (handled by ai_crew.py) and secure, internal crews (managed separately). 
Problem solved
The project initially faced security risks by routing potentially dangerous, system-modifying tasks through a public-facing API. To mitigate this, a robust, two-tiered system was designed.
Project progress
Public API: The ai_crew.py script and its associated crews have been developed for public-facing tasks.
Internal Framework: The overall architecture for the secure internal development and maintenance workflow has been planned.
Secure Entry Point: A new script, src/ai_dev_ops_crew.py, was created to define and manage the new hierarchical crew.
Secure Trigger: A separate, secure command-line script (run/internal/run_dev_ops.py) was implemented to initiate the internal workflow.
Custom Tools: The foundation for custom Git (GitTool) and file manipulation (FileTool) tools was laid in src/tools/git_tool.py.
Hierarchical Manager: An AIOpsCrewManager class was created to orchestrate the internal workflow.
Sub-crew Consolidation: The documentation and docs_writer crews were successfully consolidated into a single documentation crew.
Secure Router Setup: A module for configuring the secure internal LLM router was defined.
Directory Structure: The internal crews (developer, documentation, repo_manager, research) are organized within src/crews/internal/. 
Accomplishments
Secure Separation: The project successfully implemented a secure separation between public-facing and internal development tasks.
Hierarchical Design: The new dev ops crew utilizes a Process.hierarchical design, where a manager agent delegates sub-tasks to specialized sub-crews, mimicking a real-world project team.
Modular Architecture: The crew definitions are modular and encapsulated, making the system easy to extend and maintain.
Clear Workflow: The workflow for initiating internal tasks is well-defined and includes robust error handling and logging. 
What's left to do
To continue the project, focus on the following implementation tasks, ensuring all components are complete and correctly configured for the secure, internal workflow. 
1. Complete sub-crew implementations:
src/crews/internal/developer/: Fill in agents.py, tasks.py, and crew.py to handle code analysis, bug fixing, and testing.
src/crews/internal/documentation/: Complete agents.py, tasks.py, and crew.py for the consolidated documentation crew.
src/crews/internal/repo_manager/: Implement agents.py, tasks.py, and crew.py for repository management.
src/crews/internal/research/: Complete agents.py, tasks.py, and crew.py for the internal research crew.
2. Finalize custom tools:
src/tools/git_tool.py: Ensure GitTool and FileTool are fully implemented and robust for all necessary Git and file operations.
3. Test and secure the system:
Test all sub-crews individually to ensure they function correctly in isolation.
Test the full hierarchical workflow using the run/internal/run_dev_ops.py script.
Verify all security measures, including restricted access, proper environment variable usage, and isolated working directories. 
The next step is to begin implementing the contents of these sub-crews and tools, starting with the agents.
