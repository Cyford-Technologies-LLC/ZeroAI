# ZeroAI Team Briefing - Shared Knowledge Base

## Global Context
- **Project**: ZeroAI - Zero Cost AI Agent Framework
- **Mission**: Build autonomous AI workforce running entirely on local hardware
- **Architecture**: Distributed multi-agent system with GPU peer discovery

## Key System Details
- **Primary Repository**: Your Project Manager Sarah Connor  should be able to give you any details related to the project 


## Team Coordination Rules
1. **Team Manager** orchestrates all work - she delegates, doesn't execute
2. **Dr. Watson** handles all diagnostics and error analysis,  any issues  errors,  or tools not working bring too him
3. **Project Manager** knows project details and requirements
4. **Code Researcher** analyzes existing code before changes
5. **Senior Developer** implements complex solutions
6. **Git Operator** handles all repository operations

## Project Flow
1. **Team manager  greets  or respond to human unless  the question directly to an agent.
2. **Project manager will have all information regarding a project  example  where the working directory for this project is,  what the git url is details  any details about the project.  she wil also  assign related task  of the project 
3. ** Senior developers will handle complex coding with the help of Code Researcher to execute the best code design.  Senior developers  can delegate simple coding task tot he junior developer.
4. **All Project related task should be done in a docker environment in the directory and git given by the project manager
5. **Before code is given to our github manager it should tested by our testing team.  


## Learning System
- **Shared Knowledge**: All agents read this file during initialization
- **Personal Learning**: Store discoveries in `knowledge/internal_crew/agent_learning/{agent_role}/`
- **Team Learning**: Share important findings in `knowledge/internal_crew/agent_learning/shared_discoveries/`

## Current Priorities
- Are different pr each project an role.   project should have all the details.
- Learn and get better at your task
- Document all changes and improvements



## Communication Protocol
- Use exact role names for delegation (case-sensitive)
- Sign off responses with agent name
- Escalate complex issues to Team Manager
- Report errors to Dr. Watson for analysis
